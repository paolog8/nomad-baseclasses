Depending on the measurement software more or less meta data is provided. Here we focus on two important steps. We need to make sure that individual measurements contain relevant metadata, usually this is a quite involved task, ideas are here to convert some measurments into NeXus or to develop new standards and then making sure that the measurement software complies to these standards. Once a data file exist, independent of the quality of the metadata, we provide parser in nomad, which read the files and create entries in nomad. Ideally at least the sample id of the measured samples is provided so that the relevant linking in nomad is established (see: upload_measurement.md for a possible solution). Then uploading and processing these files to nomad is straight forward and can be either done by drag and dropping multiple measurement files or upload them via the nomad API.","title":"Measurements"},{"location":"explanation/measurements.html#measurements","text":"In contrast to synthesis, measurements come at least in a file.

Especially if these steps include information which is not stored in files automatically. This includes information on the manufacturing of solutions, but also the deposition of layers with manual Spin Coating, Slot Die Coating, and of course cleaning and annealing and quenching. All of these steps have plenty of parameters which need to be documented properly and inpart have great influence on the functional quality of the resulting devices. On the other hand we need to make sure that the manual work to document these steps for lab scientists needs to be as minimized as possible. Perovskite solar cells \u00b6 For this task we developed the experimental planning tool for perovskite solarcell synthesis. It allows to create the required synthesis information from pre-created templates and links all of these steps together. It provides tools to efficiently manipulate the templates for parameter variation. Example 1 \u00b6 I want to produce a solar cell using: Standard cleaning A standard spin-coated SAM HTL Slot Die Coating CsMAFAPbI3 as a absorber layer, where I vary the anti-solvent chemicals, and the dropping time of the anti-solvent Standard evaporation of C60 and BCP as ETLs Standard evaporation of Cu as a back contact As variable parameters I want Ethanol and Anisole as anti-solvents and exploring 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 seconds as the dropping time in each of them. Example 2 \u00b6 I want to produce a solar cell using: Standard cleaning A standard spin-coated SAM HTL AlO3 as a Slot Die Coated buffer layer, which is present in one half and absent in the other half of my batch Standard spin-coating MAPbI3 as a absorber layer Standard evaporation of C60 and BCP as ETLs Standard evaporation of Cu as a back contact The experimental planning tool is designed to document these plans efficiently provided that the standard processes exist, see: create experimental plan , create standard sample and create wet chemical deposition for more how-tos. Alternative we developed even easier to use structured excel sheets which are more intutitve to be used, see excel parsing hysprint for the nomad parser.","title":"Synthesis"},{"location":"explanation/synthesis.html#synthesis","text":"The challenging part in material science is to model the synthesis of devices, such as solar cells, properly.

Enter the number of substrates and the substrates per subbatch . It is important that the number substrates per subbatch devides the number number of substrates . In a parameter variation there is room for number of substrates devided by substrates per subbatch different variations. So if you hae 8 substrates and 2 substrates per subbatch you have 8/2=4 different parameter variations. Each variation will be applied to the whole subbatch. You can now manual change or create the information in solar cell properties and plan . plan captures the steps planned for the synthesis by reference, if you added a standard sample you can change the references. Parameter variation: for each step you can add some parameter variation. Select a step and then add the subsection parameters or click the vary parameters checkbox. If you added a parameters subsection select a parameter from the drop down menue, eg, quenching/anti_solvent_dropping_time . The unit is filled automatically but can be changed. See also set_parameters_in_experimental_plan.md to see how to select the correct parameters. Once you entered all variations click the LOAD STANDARD PROCESSES button. This copies the information from the template from the reference (or from the standard sample ) and the parameters subsection into the step As you see, there are now 8/2=4 batch processes . Now you can manually change further the parameter by navigating into the batch process . The present checkbox allows you to skip a process for a specific subbatch, just uncheck it if you for example use a buffer layer. !ATTENTION:! all manually changed data will get lost when pressing the LOAD STANDARD PROCESSES button again, this will load the template and parameter variation again as specified before. If you are happy with the plan click the CREATE SAMPLES AND PROCESSES button. This creates all samples, batches, ids and processes. This also creates an html overview which you can find in batch_plan_pdf . You can download it and open and print it with your browser.

Synthesis \u00b6 Create an experimental plan (see: create_experimental_plan.md for a how to guide). This could then look like this: In this case we used standard cleaning, and some variations in the deposition techniques, in this case the anti-solvent dropping time.

Note that the id is build from the id from the experimental plan in the synthesis, this sample is the first sample in the first subbatch. When you drag and drop your measurement file, nomad processes the file and creates a nomad JV entry: After that you can browse your upload browse_your_upload.md . You can select the Solar cell view/app, which could look like this: Analysis in jupyter \u00b6 Open the jupyter hub from nomad, see: North Tools Nomad . This could look like this: Here we provide custom functions to join the data in nomad together to plot data from synthesis and measurements together. In this way we can group the anti-solvent dropping time from before together and create box plots over the respective JV data which was measured.","title":"Solar Cells"},{"location":"tutorial/solar_cells.html#tutorial-on-solar-cells","text":"This tutorial covers the efficient documentation of the synthesis of a batch of solarcells following a standard protocol with some parameter variation, linking characterizations to the finished devices (here JV data) and accessing this data through python using jupyter and nomads API.","title":"Tutorial on solar cells"},{"location":"tutorial/solar_cells.html#synthesis","text":"Create an experimental plan (see: create_experimental_plan.md for a how to guide).
